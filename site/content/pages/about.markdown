Hi! I'm a software engineer for [Mediafly](http://www.mediafly.com) in Chicago, IL. I've found myself liking python, go, erlang, and C# these days.  

Reach out to me through the following avenues:

- Twitter: [@karl_grz](http://twitter.com/karl_grz)
- Email: karl [at] karlgrz [dot] com
- Github: [karlgrz](http://github.com/karlgrz)

Outside of coding, I write and record some music, sometimes it ends up on [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/karlgrz).
