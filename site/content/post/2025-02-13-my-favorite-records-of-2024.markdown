"2024." What can we say? Lot of life events happened, and music got me through them all.

Continuing the trend of recent memory, we are in a thriving death metal revival and I am here for it.

On to my favorites...

## 35.) Vemod - The Deepening

[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lm0LoZcw2luXcK-BbaZ4I-WGhghyKHoH0) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7HHqmpCFNWbays2hvMVAKW?si=449d695509c24584)

Clean guitar and clean singing throughout. Incredibly well done arrangements. The first track was a very slow burn but it had me hooked by the end.

## 34.) Pallbearer - Mind Burns Alive
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Pallbearer.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m7waJWeZP2PSFiLyD0b6txtepsUsmpC2E) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5ppoXtj1diskTKxHyuChWI?si=5cc03b7a22404421)

Incredible record. They've really come into their own. Last couple records have been very strong progressions of song writing and performance. Love this one. And the Sax!!!

## 33.) Wormwood - The Star

Unexpected greatness. Lot of critics cite this one as being too fragmented and scatterbrained but I disagree, I love the writing and the concept and the production.

## 32.) Sound&Shape - Pillars of Creation

Closest I've heard to El Cielo since...El Cielo, heh.

This reminded me a lot of Anti-God Hand from last year. Incredible album. Tons of range and the songwriting is outstanding.

This is the goods. One of the better black metal records of the year.

## 28.) Black Birch - S/T

[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kVnDvJz217ah7N_YqWl-dXQJt29xiGBpo) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1S8MZWq44EYj22tTDKcYob?si=d3396b27277e4138)

Wonderful black metal record. Everything I want in the genre is on display here. Wild vocals, frenetic drums, lo fi but not terrible production, great guitar hooks.

## 27.) Dawn Treader - Bloom & Decay
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/DawnTreader.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_k1wVm1X0jRfqWuIUBk1J8UicuTR1B_nxQ) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3UpbCkeH3w3XVNDHgik8kA?si=dea3f6315f2b4b2c)

Dissonant and wonderfully filthy.

## 26.) Pyrrhon - Exhaust

[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l8l4rN671UMu267jIK0-u59Hs3x3w6jwA) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6LR5BqfoHHYGSCg4C40Qnr?si=614b548858944198)

Love this band. Organized chaos at it's finest. They really embrace and go all in on the weird riffs and polyrhythm stuff they do on this album.

## 25.) Horna - Nyx (Hymnejä yölle)
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Horna.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kLh0eRIksaR1gzaV8nk3DQyNCkut6HDsU) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3zyVDtjmtKuQepDpAo7yiX?si=7d960f71657f43e9)

Oh baby. Wow. Unexpected greatness here. Some of the catchiest guitar riffs of the year. So good.

![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/GlacialTomb.jpg)

Khemmis guitarist and bassist, great album. Riffs on riffs on riffs! And what is going on with this incredible album artwork?!

## 23.) Gaerea - Coma

[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n_sXfUTdgXnPL5UHXoqK8DPUWbdLj5W78) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4i9i7I98VBon2pJOWBtbX1?si=9268c870c8b6430b)

Incredible record. Huge growth on this one. This band has something special with the adrenaline in their song writing. Goose bumps all the time. Outstanding. Love this band.

## 22.) Spectral Lore - IV (Part 1)
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/SpectralLore.jpg)
[Bandcamp](https://spectrallore.bandcamp.com/album/iv-part-1)

Incredible album. Looking forward to part 2. Arrangements and guitar work is wonderful, really interesting songwriting.

## 21.) Spectral Wound - Songs of Blood and Mire
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/SpectralWound.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lndijt9qkWJPn0eN-8nn-M-eH4ohqEY94) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2AljWxmNh0mQPFAKAwKlIt?si=ac391d06ea3e4535)

Great record. Loved this. Very interesting arrangements and guitar melodies. Good production for black metal (lofi but not shitty sounding.)

## 20.) Replicant - Infinite Mortality
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Replicant.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ndDMWufvDbSIOFRxfHaD-Rxozet8CFwQg) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/74ATExo0pciDQU4qxzgbJM?si=529d900c5a0546df)

Good shit. This is really great dissonant death metal.

## 19.) Night Verses - Every Sound Has a Color in the Valley of Night
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/NightVerses.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_loEbMa371mk7URFfRbtN3aB4MSz9rnxS8) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6vcoKJhkNPj3HeTOudcRLO?si=b79a8c0a4a11418e)

Whoa. Second half of this was equally as incredible as the first. Makes the first part that much better and more impactful, in my opinion. Masterpiece.

## 18.) Knocked Loose - You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/KnockedLoose.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kIKIGNHqZjl6KvbVuKXthqyVxIrSNPuLQ) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2sLBMdUF5HYNB0voqWs4K3?si=a4d1620fdca4476d)

Wow. This blew me away. The Poppy feature that got nominated for a Grammy (Suffocate) is in the running for my favorite song of the year.

## 17.) Black Curse - Burning in a Celestial Poison
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/BlackCurse.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l0d229FBiq-OLWLL01BLhOMowMBY1_SXE) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/28J6arbbo80DntlG4iayWI?si=c23a8ad4c53e4d13)

Whoa, this is the goods. Frenetic and wonderful. Cool cast of characters, too.

## 16.) Oak, Ash, & Thorn - Our Grief is Thus
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/OakAshAndThorn.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nlbF085PUQgNVQTXP7EGRZvJ8xGPPDE_A) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3Qgd9FmhpTLRKmUGtMpcRc?si=4a2ed3b7d05e4f9b)

Not expecting this level of greatness. Reminds me a lot of Khemmis. Excellent record. Melodies, harmonies, drum heroics, this album has it all.

## 15.) Huntsmen - The Dry Land
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Huntsmen.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mKLBUCU0LpJG5x6IdqmaVm5cLG7OcJEVc) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6nS0L8bWPTkFuKdEy9j2Tz?si=2fd3b7f7d1db4f30)

Whoa baby. Loved this. Incredible vocal harmonies, love the arrangements. Huge growth in songwriting from Mandala of Fear. Huge production.

## 14.) Vale of Pnath - Between the Worlds of Life and Death
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/ValeOfPnath.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nPM2n02E4--Vaowu1ve8fND47CF3ispZw) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Z8BLgcS7m6vycYBJzjhzo?si=ac91741ced404614)

I expect we'll be celebrating the 10th anniversary of this album. Shred city.

## 13.) Julie Christmas - Ridiculous and Full of Blood
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/JulieChristmas.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nzn0TpG5DVAWFFOm5XGdl1EUJ3dBJNGKU) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4nfF9AA2zA50pozCSaIX13?si=41ff626036f24c06)

Big fan of Julie Christmas and this album has been wonderful. Supernatural is one of my favorite songs of the year. The Lighthouse is really good, too, with Johannes from Cult of Luna.

## 12.) Job For a Cowboy - Moon Healer
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/JobForACowboy.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_k9OXS8tpkQLKayL4Jp4WZO08I4uW_iJN8) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2nYVbfF20AiedBTYcswFAW?si=97b1c6c48c86416d)

Unexpectedly amazing. One of the proggiest metal releases of the year so far. Incredible rhythm section. Seriously. Outstanding record and a gigantic progression in their level of musicianship and songwriting.

## 11.) Bedsore - Dreaming the Strife for Love
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Bedsore.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kGwc6DWvA_8wt8OnIet1x6e-XcTWuU0iQ) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3KFaCfyta9b7t08QAXuI5P?si=7d4ebab3f7d04fde)

Weird as fuck. Sounds like Ray Manzorek playing with Dog Fashion Disco, maybe. Great record. Weird in the best ways.

## 10.) Slimelord - Chytridiomycosis Relinquished
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Slimelord.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kL7PY_2hzgKBTuz9aATnM5IBcT_KOAo0I) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/59htiEOknLAKuGr6dgdpVg?si=65dbae22d78a475e)

Incredible. Right up my alley. Long death metal songs, heh. Filthy production, great riffs, great writing, really cool melodies. And that album artwork is something else.

## 9.) Inter Arma - New Heaven
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/InterArma.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kMmxa8kZh747aCd9kHWMwfnKGusseQnVE) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0HB3RzsvBPT3s0MzSjbdU7?si=0eed8bbc2be74d77)

I think I'd put it between Paradise Gallows and Sulphur English in my list of their discog favs. Wonderful record. This band continues to push themselves and prove why they are one of the best to do the damn thing.

## 8.) Paysage D'Hiver - Die Berge
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/PaysageDHiver.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kVDySOqrw3TLYiIb8jbYXue7ZHt-S_nMk) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0p1qTZbgcKqnznB6aZiKmR?si=79f2ad93b174481e)

First two tracks are perfect. Rest of the album is equally wonderful, but the first two could have been on their own and that would have been wonderful, too. Great album. That said, I like Im Wald better, I think. But this is second best overall in discography to me.

## 7.) Oranssi Pazuzu - Muuntautuja
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/OranssiPazuzu.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_myO65Uo8arIlwg1K9Yt1byotSxcS30np4) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6cRCD79pIJvu5aeKWVtskd?si=20ef3aa5f0d34abf)

This band is wacky and I am here for it. Great stuff. Weird as fuck and creepy as hell. Nightmare music.

## 6.) SLIFT - ILION
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Slift.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kpJjcL-HDkVpIwi6c5TSWi58NRqzotuDE) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/13eFPkUHYAhYQ7uSSm9It3?si=e0f22e1cb658459a)

Wonderful Elder-like. Some truly wonderful guitar tones throughout. Great songs.

## 5.) Vitriol - Suffer & Become
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Vitriol.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m5SEBB2jhkwuGg0b-hN3FfaKpm0nJB2W8) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0UnX0ja0G3MbEGZhEWhXk9?si=e22e977b49664a38)

One of the best death metal records I've heard in a long time, and that's saying something. Incredible songwriting and performances. Kyle riffs so hard and flies all over the fretboard with ease and taste. Shame and it's Afterbirth might be the best death metal song I've heard in decades. Incredible. It's too bad they fell apart on the tour for this record.

## 4.) Kendrick Lamar - GNX
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/KendrickLamar.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lONzr2WDx7bOXJWJNC1YloDy76sCBUHyw) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0hvT3yIEysuuvkK73vgdcW?si=oVeONXCTRGaxSzPFX3Vyeg)

Solid. Not sure where this sits in his discography for me yet, time will tell...pretty high up there, though. wacced out murals, squabble up, tv off, peekaboo...whole album is bangers.

## 3.) Cave Sermon - Divine Laughter
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/CaveSermon.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mSneYCMvUa4nPuCX3ZqfqPR1yr2M1ar-U) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/26LoNV75PRYRIZBj89kLFn?si=391e283f48ec4c78)

Whoa. Good shit. Great production and songwriting. Long songs! Lots of pretty parts amidst the savagery. There's something interesting this band does with rhythms and syncopations that you don't hear very often in progressive death metal. It's like they find a way to make the beat and rhythm it's own instrument, if that makes sense? This band should be huge.

## 2.) Ulcerate - Cutting the Throat of God
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/Ulcerate.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mKGnsqCLZ0ty4NDVUmJIvgj21wtzQV0e8) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2QNcQNDeIvL0EWOSP87iSm?si=PGHJjrC9QASd-GIOf92UyQ)

BIG HYPE!!! This was outstanding. Dissonant death at it's finest. One of the best drumming performances of the year, maybe the decade. Outstanding record and, any other year, this gets my top spot. Alas...

## 1.) Blood Incantation - Absolute Elsewhere
![](/images/2025-02-13-my-favorite-records-of-2024/BloodIncantation.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m3LIJ3ftIsDg-XlVNYoGC-O851WAnkig8) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7hriIeLMviZKpNfcXgpsd8?si=163734eff6194418)

Album of the year. Wow. Amazing record. What a journey! This is so dense. Great voyage. I love the guitars, synths, vocals, drums, bass, heh, everything about this is wonderful. Masterfully written and arranged. This record has everything I enjoy about interesting music. It leans in to the psychdelic synths for the right amount of time to leave them feeling impactful every time they rear their head to the foreground. Nothing about this feels forced or "extra" and everything fits. I used to describe Between the Buried and Me as the "Pink Floyd of Death Metal" but uh, Blood Incantation is that band now. One of the best albums I have ever heard, period. Cannot fathom where they go next, but I want to experience it. Album of the year, at least. Album of the decade? Only time will tell.
