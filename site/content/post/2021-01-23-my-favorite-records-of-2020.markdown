"2020". What a fucking year. There was a lot of personal hardships encountered by a lot of people around the globe. I was no exception to this theme, in countless ways. Like all times of struggle, music is something that has always helped me to keep my head above water when all hope seems lost. My bands were banking on 2020 being huge years. Both [Uncouth](https://uncouthchicago.bandcamp.com), who have been sitting on a 10 song LP waiting to get back into our rehearsal space to perfect it before we begin tracking and had several huge shows lined up that were cancelled due to COVID, and [Tides Cult](https://tidescult.bandcamp.com) who are in the midst of writing a debut full length and were poised for some truly great performances in 2020. Alas, like always, you have to take life in stride and make the most of what you have. I'm truly thankful to have my health and family and friends to be able to share in the present and hope that 2021 and beyond is a better time for us all. According to [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/karlgrz/library/albums?from=2020-01-01&to=2021-01-07), I still listened to a lot of music despite the wacky year. There was so much great stuff that came out last year. I have a feeling 2021 will have even more great stuff, as everyone was writing during the lockdowns and getting prepped for whenever shows can happen again. I miss live music so much and ache for that feeling of getting my face melted by overloud tube amps at Empty Bottle or Livewire or Reggie's again. I didn't release any records last year, but I did participate in some [collaborations](https://soundcloud.com/erik-oldman-music/chicago-collaboration-1) that were really fun, and released a new [Once Upon A Grave](https://soundcloud.com/karlgrz/raining-iron-in-antarctica) song, which inspired me to dust that project off for 2021. I'm looking forward to releasing a bunch of stuff in 2021.

And now, on to my favorites of the year...

## 35.) Wayfarer - A Romance With Violence
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Wayfarer.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_HAcE68IxJnb) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3QgcRjIIRDWkvBq9el0GGo)
A worthy follow up to World's Blood. You get the feeling you're in the wild west listening to these tales over a campfire jam session instead of a blackened metal opus. So great.

## 34.) Liturgy - Origin of the Alimonies
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Liturgy.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_OC2kGK4a2Xr) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Q84MVz6dS62QsAzBiFTwY)
This record was so fantastically performed and arranged, I love everything about this. I was describing this as "black metal filtered by an NES" and that is probably the best I can do. This is just outstanding, huge respect to Hunter Hunt-Hendrix.

## 33.) Emma Ruth Rundle & Thou - May Our Chambers Be Full
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/EmmaRuthRundleThou.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_5dHYa5Dp7DY) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6X2TkIjKz0JmifXmr0Tj79)
The most perfect collaboration. Emma Ruth Rundle is one of the last artists I saw live before the lockdowns (along with Intronaut and Cult of Luna, great show!), I miss live music so much...This record is crushing and beautiful at the exact same time. They should do this more often.

## 32.) Ancient Thrones - The Veil
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/AncientThrones.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_4M0njIb034m) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1sLvttPvtFPWk1gARQXcpp)
Big surprise to me on this one. Blackened death metal at it's finest. This is great, spin it from start to finish in one siting really loud.

## 31.) Wake - Devouring Ruin
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Wake.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_xqQmqBikReb) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0HPwpmR523VvXMFtnXPKT6)
Crushing. 46 minute record from a grindcore band?! 10 minute long song!? Hell yes. More, please. So many influences on this record, you can obviously feel the grind but tons of doom and black metal and death metal creep in, too. Love this.

## 30.) Hashfinger, Butta, MC Synergy - Hash Butta Synergy
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/HashfingerButtaMCSynergy.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_va2zAyJq6l6) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0YOEYoxTw7X6R3PZFLWJbi)
In 20 years, I want to be at the anniversary full album performance of this record. Every single song on this is a banger. My friend [Mike](https://mikeniebling.com) turned me onto this one, one of my most listened to records of the year.

## 29.) Toundra - Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Toundra.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_3y3odABIPts) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/08y4jMFcpVaS7MlANeI4Bp)
Huge mood. I'd love to see this band live with Russian Circles and Godspeed, You! Black Emperor or something. The keys on this are standout.

## 28.) Leeched - To Dull the Blades of Your Abuse
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Leeched.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_xD8apmTBrwP) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/15sO343d19HWDUI0WjwSL9)
Give me my face back, y'all ripped it off.

## 27.) Bohren & Der Club of Gore - Patchouli Blue
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/BohrenDerClubOfGore.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_rW0vjD8jL2l) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/57Jc5ixqmNuGudtV51M5aG)
Deep chill and vibees on this one. Love the synths. The sax steals the show, though.

## 26.) Thy Catafalque - Naiv
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/ThyCatafalque.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_jrsPBaeHLXw) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2eH5WM6pIPFsFylP5sbOi9)
Wild! This record goes all over the place. If you like metal and are looking for a good time, call Thy Catafalque.

## 25.) Deftones - Ohms
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Deftones.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_OsY0osplAus) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0VEFy5MsBiq0u2lWL0OwOd)
It's a Deftones record. I loved this. Steph's guitar riffs are really forward throughout this one. The whole band sounds tighter than they did on Gore (which I enjoyed). Ohms, the song, is the most Deftones song since Be Quiet and Drive.

## 24.) Beneath the Massacre - Fearmonger
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/BeneathTheMassacre.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_7aqQEypmHzG) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1q7U1NxOyWTzoS3cpqtQpS)
Tech death from Canada. I think I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDAZztJQyck) of Anthony Barone's drum playthrough of the first track, Rise of the Fearmonger, about a billion times last year. Every time I watch it it makes me want to quit music. Incredible. This whole record incredible.

## 23.) Lifetaker - Night Intruder
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Lifetaker.jpg)
[Bandcamp](https://lifetaker.bandcamp.com/album/night-intruder) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/12JP2Ckzxe4FmgjdxFcn1J)
Filthy, grindy, punked up, blackened "fuck you" metal from Germany. Never heard of them before and then this entire record tore my face off. I'd love to play a show with these dudes. They released *another* killer record, [Pit Viper](https://lifetaker.bandcamp.com/album/pit-viper), at the very end of 2020, as well. Equally killer. Check this band out.

## 22.) Gaerea - Limbo
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Gaerea.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_EEqw9bQLfk7) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3de7oPmnHzjhKwWHqbxRI1)
Cinematic atmospheric black metal. The first time I ever heard them was this video for [Conspiranoia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQLLEqazToY) and I was hooked. This record lived up to the hype, in my opinion.

## 21.) Hallowed Butchery - Deathsongs From The Hymnal Of The Church Of The Final Pilgrimage
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/HallowedButchery.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_ItYagninY7o) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4UWzbLJflwEVkOOlkZ548z)
One dude from Maine, Ryan Scott Fairfield. Funeral doom but this record is anything except "just" that. This is a wild listen.

## 20.) Plague Organ - Orphan
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/PlagueOrgan.jpg)
[Bandcamp](https://plagueorgan.bandcamp.com/album/orphan) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4AD61eo2b0FnpF2fiVd4Pv)
This is what I imagine a peyote trip sounds like. 38 minutes of droning black metal without any guitars. I love this record.

## 19.) Necrot - Mortal
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Necrot.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_cIP2jyNSYze) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2l4hEQgW6UT5yHrr5xfmZr)
You know what you're getting here. Death metal. And it fucks. Outstanding riffs throughout this one.

## 18.) Black Thought - Streams of Thought, Vol. 3: Cane & Able
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/BlackThought.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_PMPIbKfZcGD) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2LEEg9PQsJqQuhBU0poSrd)
I love The Roots, but Black Thought's solo records are taking over for me. This is an incredible hip hop record.

## 17.) Oranssi Pazuzu - Mestarin kynsi
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/OranssiPazuzu.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_3bwO4Nj6eI1) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0gsk1RGjMrtEDE05s0TZMf)
This isn't black metal, but it is black metal. It's not psych metal, but it's psych metal. I don't know how to describe Oranssi Pazuzu. This record is a wild ass ride in a psychedelic motorcade down the black metal highway.

## 16.) END - Splinters from an Ever-Changing Face
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/End.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_Vt5Hko7z7cT) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6X3196GAOJl9oHyQC2YJNm)
Start to finish, this album is monstrous. Some of the most crushing breakdowns ever put to tape.

## 15.) Hexecutor - Beyond Any Human Conception of Knowledge...
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Hexecutor.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_3jFsiEZWdOM) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0OviDwvisA2NwX1tSgYws5)
This is a fun record! Traditional black metal and some great thrashy, deathy guitar heroics.

## 14.) Ingested - Where Only Gods May Tread
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Ingested.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_KgKn2UIjsTs) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2HfR7vjgwDKTivJe2m3caa)
Blast you in the face heavy. Incredible production. Phenomenal drum performance.

## 13.) Pallbearer - Forgotten Days
![](/images/2021-02-04-my-favorite-records-of-2020/Pallbearer.jpg)
[Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPREb_NrEutSutp5u) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7j2AkxHOjfHWD4HSsh7QD5)
I love Pallbearer. When I first heard this, I thought it was their best record, but with their worst production. I've come around on the production, and I still think this is their best record yet. The songs on this one are outstanding. Every time I put on Silver Wings I get goosebumps. The vocal harmonies they're going for nowadays are way more adventurous than they've ever tried and I'm here for it.

## 12.) Crippled Black Phoenix - Ellengæst
