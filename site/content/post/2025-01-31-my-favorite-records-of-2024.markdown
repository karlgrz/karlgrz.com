SLIFT - ILION (10 / 10) AOTY candidate. Wonderful Elder-like. Some truly wonderful guitar tones throughout. Great songs.
Vitriol - Suffer & Become (10 / 10) AOTY candidate. One of the best death metal records I've heard in a long time, and that's saying something. Incredible songwriting and performances. Kyle riffs so hard and flies all over the fretboard with ease and taste. Shame and it's Afterbirth might be the best death metal song I've heard in decades. Incredible. time will tell but this is so good, I am calling it my AOTY right now, haha. 3 listens and it's still great.
Cave Sermon - Divine Laughter (10 / 10) Whoa. Good shit. Great production and songwriting. Long songs! Might need to revisit this one again. Lots of pretty parts amidst the savagery.

Night Verses - Every Sound Has a Color in the Valley of Night (10 / 10) Whoa. Second half of this was equally as incredible as the first. Makes the first part that much better and more impactful, in my opinion. Masterpiece.
Oak, Ash, & Thorn - Our Grief is Thus (10 / 10) Wow. Not expecting this level of greatness. Reminds me a lot of Khemmis. Excellent record. Spin #2 is equally good. 10/10 i think. Riffs, melodies, harmonies, drum heroics, this album has it all. AOTY candidate.
Inter Arma - New Heaven (10 / 10) BIG HYPE!!! Really good. I think I'd put it between Paradise Gallows and Sulphur English in my list of their discog favs. Wonderful record. AOTY candidate.
Vemod - The Deepening (10 / 10) AOTY Candidate. Wow. this was powerful. Clean guitar and clean singing throughout. Incredibly well done arrangements. The first track was a very slow burn but it had me hooked by the end. Need to relisten. So very good.
Knocked Loose - You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To (10 / 10) Looking forward to this one a lot. Hopefully it's like A Tear in the Fabric of Life and less like A Different Shade of Blue (I like the former a lot more than the latter but ADSoB is good too). Wow. This blew me away. Not expecting that good of a record from them. 10/10 on first listen.
Pallbearer - Mind Burns Alive (10 / 10) Incredible record. They've really come into their own. Last couple records have been very strong progressions of song writing and performance. Love this one. And the Sax!!!
Wormwood - The Star (10 / 10) Wow, unexpected greatness. Lot of critics cite this one as being too fragmented and scatterbrained but I disagree, I love the writing and the concept and the production. AOTY candidate for me.

Seth - La France des Maudits (10 / 10) This is the goods. One of the better black metal records of the year.
Black Birch - S/T (10 / 10) The goods. Wonderful black metal record. Everything I want in the genre is on display here. Wild vocals, frenetic drums, lo fi but not terrible production, great guitar hooks. AOTY candidate.

Dawn Treader - Bloom & Decay (10 / 10) Excellent record. AOTY candidate. Dissonant and wonderfully filthy.

Paysage D'Hiver - Die Berge (10 / 10) First two tracks are perfect. Rest of the album is equally wonderful. Great album. AOTY candidate. That said, I like Im Wald better, I think. But this is second best overall in discography to me.
Bedsore - Dreaming the Strife for Love (10 / 10) Weird as fuck. Ray Manzorek playing with Dog Fashion Disco, maybe. Great record. Weird in the best ways. AOTY contender.
Spectral Lore - IV (Part 1) (10 / 10) Incredible album. Looking forward to part 2. Arrangements and guitar work is wonderful, really interesting songwriting and it all works quite nicely.

Knoll - As Spoken (9.5 / 10) whoa. awesome start. Frenetic and vicious. Good stuff. A little samey throughout, score reflects it. Very close to a perfect record.
meth. - SHAME (9.5 / 10) Whoa. Grim and filthy. Dissonant. Lots of space. Very dark. I loved the ending of the album. Monstrous. Might need to revisit it again, I'm on 9.5 on initial listen but might be a 10?
Chelsea Wolfe - She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She (9.5 / 10) Big hype! This is shaping up to be on par with Abyss and Hiss Spun for me as her tops. Outstanding songwriting and ambience.
Slimelord - Chytridiomycosis Relinquished (9.5 / 10) Incredible. Right up my alley. Long death metal songs, heh. Filthy production, great riffs, great writing, really cool melodies. Loved this. AOTY candidate for sure, need to relisten in the car and on my speakers. Have a feeling this goes from my initial 9.5 to a 10 after a few listens.
Replicant - Infinite Mortality (9.5 / 10) Good shit. Listened to this first time, gave 8.5, second time I give 9.5, this is really great death metal. It's possibly a 10, too, not quite sure.
Taylor Swift - THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY (9.5 / 10) Sounds like Tay Tay's The Cure album, at least so far. This was really good. Long, but in a good way. I think my favorites were The Prophecy and Down Bad. Probably needs a relisten.
Bongripper - Empty (9.5 / 10) Fuck yes.
Cognitive - Abhorrence (9.5 / 10) Awesome record!
Gatecreeper - Dark Superstition (9.5 / 10) Catchy as hell. Probably gateway to death metal. The song structures are addictive and accessible in ways that death metal has never been. Awesome record.

Rotting Christ - Pro Xristou (9.5 / 10) awesome record, loved this

MONO - OATH (9.5 / 10) Outstanding record. This might be my favorite Mono record so far, maybe? Film noir as a genre. SO GOOD.
Alcest - Les Chants de l'Aurore (9.5 / 10) Wonderful. I dunno if this or Kodoma is better. Really well done. Should listen again. AOTY candidate, probably.
Krallice - Inorganic Rites (9.5 / 10) KRALLICE! Damn, this was really good. Great mix of synths and shred. One of their better records in the last several years. Gotta revisit it again but it's gonna be towards the tops for me I can imagine.
Hemwick - Acedia (9.5 / 10) Wow. This is one of the better EPs ive ever heard. Incredibly good. Well thought out and arranged instrumental progressive death metal. Can an EP make the AOTY list? Yes.
Feind - Ambulante Hirnamputation (9.5 / 10) This is the goods. Grindcore at it's finest. Can't understand the lyrics but that's ok. Short and sweet. Drums are tasty, and I loved the guitar production too.
Spectral Wound - Songs of Blood and Mire (9.5 / 10) Great record. Loved this. Need to relisten on better speakers, I was on my earbuds. Very interesting arrangements and guitar melodies. Good production for black metal (lofi but not shitty sounding)

Sons of Ra - Tropic of Cancer (9 / 10) Got a sneak peek at this from Erik. Killer record. Great tones and performances.

Resin Tomb - Cerebral Purgatory (9 / 10) Great album. Awesome guitar tone and songs.
Luciferian Rites - Oath of Midnight Ashes (9 / 10) Wonderful black metal record. Well written and performed. Vocal performance is cool, it's got the gamut and all the extremes on both ends (shrieking and blorches)
Vipassi - Lightless (9 / 10) Good stuff. Incredible bass playing. Great arrangements.
Necrowretch - Swords of Dajjal (9 / 10) Great record. Production was crisp and clear for black metal, loved the vocal production and arrangement and songwriting. Breakdowns reminiscent of Tides Cult.
Them Moose Rush - Zepaxia (9 / 10) Wild record. Really cool arrangements and songwriting. Some very, VERY interesting songs. Should revisit, possible top 10 candidate.
Aureole - Alunarian Bellmaster (9 / 10) Wild and wacky! Fresh take on black metal, I loved this. Really cool arrangements that aren't really black metal but aren't really industrial, they're just a new thing, or something? Really cool.
Spectral Voice - Sparagmos (9 / 10) Huge album, Loved this. Lots of hype, and it has some parts that are a bit draggy, but overall I loved this. Great atmosphere and build ups and then the pay offs are all really nice. Good guitar tones, and the drums are really nice. Loved the vocals.

Julia Holter - Something in the Room She Moves (9 / 10) Loved this. Production was incredible. The chanting thing was weird but I dug it, might skip it in the future. Otherwise, incredibly cool arrangements and songwriting.

Austere - Beneath the Threshold (9 / 10) This was awesome. Probably need to relisten to this but I really enjoyed it.
Benighted - Ekbom (9 / 10) Drums are absolutely brutal on this. Great arrangements and I really dug the vocal delivery a lot more than most grindcore records. Great production. Guitars sounded awesome. LONG songs for grindcore (most songs 3:00 or longer, wild)
Greyhaven - Stereo Grief (9 / 10) Damn this rules. Wish it was an LP, but I'll take this EP. Great record.
High on Fire - Cometh the Storm (9 / 10) Great album. Matt Pike's vocals are hit or miss throughout, like usual, but it doesn't matter much. Songs are great. I love that they will bury a riff into the earth and let it linger. Good stuff.
Antichrist Siege Machine - Vengeance of Eternal Fire (9 / 10) Oh yes! Really good grind record
Ariana Grande - eternal sunshine (9 / 10) Good record! Incredible production as usual. Supernatural might dethrone Dance the Night by Dua Lipa for me :-)

Squid Pisser - Dreams of Puke (9 / 10) Wild and wacky. This was great.
Rezn - Burden (9 / 10) Awesome record! I think Let It Burn is still my favorite, but this one is probably second now. The sax is becoming a bigger part of their core sound and it's really awesome.

Liminal Shroud - Visions of Collapse (9 / 10) Cool stuff. Not as much as I liked the previous one, but this was awesome nonetheless
Scarcity - The Promise of Rain (9 / 10) This is cool. Dissonant and weird, spastic riffs. Slight reminder of Gorrch with the frenetic guitar playing over the driving drums. But a different thing entirely. Good record.
Vuur & Zijde - Boezum (9 / 10) Very cool. Shoegazy, blackgazey kinda record. Melody is on point. Can't understand the lyrics but that's ok. Solid as hell record.
Ghost - Rite Here Rite Now (9 / 10) Good set list, great production.
Summoning the Lich - Under The Reviled Throne (9 / 10) Black Dahlia Murder lite. Quite enjoyed this. Their vocalist is definitely a fan of Trevor, in a good way. Great record.
Wormwitch - Wormwitch (9 / 10) Good record. A little samey but this is the goods
Defacement - Duality (9 / 10) Cool dissonant death metal record. Electronics segues were cool. Pretty cool shit, the last song in particular is very good.
Fleshgod Apocalypse - Opera (9 / 10) Very good. I need to probably listen to this one again. The vocal harmonies are really something special on this one.
Melt-Banana - 3+5 (9 / 10) Wild and crazy. Good stuff. Really infectious melodies and arrangements. The vocals were exactly as fucked up as I was hoping for heh
Anciients - Beyond the Reach of the Sun (9 / 10) Man this band is wonderful. This is really good. Dense and beautifully arranged. Love the use of acoustics to heighten the mood. Production is solid. Riffs are fucking slamming. Drums are out of this world. Good album.
Leprous - Melodies of Atonement (9 / 10) Great record. Different from Aphelion in which this one is "Einar in the background" instead of "Einar needs a solo project" heh. Limbo might be the hookiest guitar hook all year. This was wonderful, I probably need to relisten.

Bewitcher - Shell Shock (9 / 10) Very fun record! Black metal & Roll! Good stuff. Reminds me of Midnight or Cloak. Dig it!
The Black Dahlia Murder - Servitude (9 / 10) The masters are back at it. Pretty solid record. It's not a 10 because it seems like Brian is still finding his footing, but the guitar / bass / drums work on this are exceptional. Ryan Knight and Brandon Ellis bring it hard on the shred.
Sungazer - Against the Fall of Night (9 / 10) This is great! Plini guest was unreal.
Cosmic Putrefaction - Emerald Fires Atop the Farewell Mountains (9 / 10) Really good but not as spectacular as their last one. I agree with Zac heh. Still very very good.
The Armed - Everlasting Gaze (9 / 10) Martyr Song might be the best The Armed song yet. Glorious. Not a bad EP.
Better Lovers - Highly Irresponsible (9 / 10) Great record, I liked this a lot more than the EP and way more than Many Eyes. Riffs on riffs and Greg Puciato brining it.
Gigan - Anomalous Abstractigate Infinitessimus (9 / 10) Wacky and crazy death metal. Good shit. Lots of interesting guitar work and frenetic drumming. Good vocals. Really cool song arrangements.
Living Gate - Suffering As One (9 / 10) Supergroup of Yob, Wiegedood, Oathbreaker, and Amenra. Very good record. Interesting songs and great production

Thy Catalfaque - XII: A gyönyörű álmok ezután jönnek (9 / 10) Great album.
Misanthropy - The Ever-Crushing Weight of Stagnance (9 / 10) The guitars are batshit. And the drums. Really cool song writing. Dig it a lot. Cooler than just a cookie cutter tech death.
WHARFLURCH - Shittier / Slimier (9 / 10) unreleased demos compiled into a release. Cool tunes. I love this band.
