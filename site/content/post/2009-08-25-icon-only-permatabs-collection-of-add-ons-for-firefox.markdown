This might not be news to everyone (or anyone...) but the kind folks over at [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com) have put together a [great post](http://lifehacker.com/5344395/icon+only-permatabs-collection-streamlines-your-minimal-gmail-google-reader-tabs) that streamlines how to set up permanent tabs in Firefox and some other goodies for GMail & Google Reader. I've been using this set up for only about an hour or so and I am already kicking myself for not installing Better GMail 2 & Better GReader 2 before today (considering how much I use these applications). Kudos!
