"2021".

What a fucking year. Part 2.

I didn't release any records last year, but I did participate in some [collaborations](https://soundcloud.com/erik-oldman-music/chicago-collaboration-1) that were really fun, and released a new [Once Upon A Grave](https://soundcloud.com/karlgrz/raining-iron-in-antarctica) song, which inspired me to dust that project off for 2021. I'm looking forward to releasing a bunch of stuff in 2021 and beyond.

2 hours. That's a long time for a record. That's a long time to demand of a listener nowadays. I am all about long records, and I love it when artists indulge the listeners who do enjoy the deep dive into the rabbit hole. This record is more like the cinematic experience of a film to me than an album, and that length is a big part in making that a great adventure.

There was a period of almost a month where this was all I listened to. I was enthralled, almost obsessed with experiencing it again and again. Lofi black metal can be an acquired taste, and sometimes there is quite a fine line between artful and overdoing it. Wintherr has found the absolute perfect blend of musicianship and arrangement to bring his vision to life. It's cold as the tundra. Hypnotic, almost.

There are so many fantastic musical moments throughout this record, but one of my favorite happens at the end of Le rêve lucide, flowing into Eulengesang, and the payoff into Kälteschauer. The ever present wind throughout this passage is haunting every single time. And then, when you least suspect it, the madness continues.

I haven't connected this viscerally and profoundly with a piece of music since Baroness' Yellow & Green. It's as if this album was tailor made to evoke the maximum response from my brain. It's not for everyone, that's for sure, but this is, without question, my favorite record of the year.
