One of the greatest shredders to ever pick up an axe, [Dimebag Darrell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimebag_Darrell) of [Pantera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantera) and [DamagePlan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damageplan) fame, was shot and killed onstage in Columbus, Ohio 5 years ago today in a heinous act, along with others that tried to stop the killer, and the killer himself.

Today, appreciate the people around you. Appreciate life. Appreciate music. I'll be blasting Pantera all day in memory of one of the greatest metal guitarist of our time. This one's for you, Darrell. You are missed.
