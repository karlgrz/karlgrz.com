As of October 26th, 2009, I am a new homeowner!

It's been a pretty rough couple of weeks getting things set up. The home I purchased is in [Elgin, IL](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Elgin,+IL&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.223579,79.013672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Elgin,+Kane,+Illinois&z=12), a suburb of Chicago about 20 minutes from my office. Myself and my girlfriend, Karen, are currently living there. We got the whole house painted (there were some VERY BRIGHT yellows all over that place...) and mostly furnished, and now the few maintainance issues I have to address are on the task list. There is really nothing too major to handle (the last things I need to do are replace the leaky kitchen faucet, run the bathroom exhaust fan out of the side of the home, and patch up a capped-off pipe under the kitchen sink).  
  
The home I purchased was a foreclosure, but surprisingly the previous owners kept the place in pretty good condition. It is a very old home (almost 100 years old!) but has a lot of character and a HUGE backyard! Plus it has a full basement (partially finished), so I can set up all my music studio goodness down there.  
  
I have internet getting hooked up tomorrow afternoon, so I will definitely be back to my posting frequency once that is finished. I'm **LOVIN'** this place so far! And I will probably love it even more around tax time when I get that sweet First Time Homebuyers tax credit :-)
