So I've been working on a little side project web app to get familiar with both [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (a python web microframework) and [zeromq](http://www.zeromq.org) (the socket library that acts as a concurrency framework), along with [remix](http://echonest.github.com/remix/) from [echonest](http://the.echonest.com/). 

There was [this exchange](https://twitter.com/karl_grz/status/296127411567869952) with Brad from [devmynd](http://www.devmynd.com/) tonight on twitter. 

Coupled with the promise of tons of rain from our friendly neighborhood meteorologist, I was inspired to create this unholy amalgamation of mash up nonsense. Behold, Milli Vanilli v. Mastodon in: Blame It On The Megalodon! Warning: your ears cannot unhear this, for better or worse.

Enjoy!
